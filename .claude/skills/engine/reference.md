# Reference — engine internals

Lookup companion to [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). The skill is the *workflow* (design
from the functional model → fit invariants → plan → implement); this is the
quick-reference and the [`templates/`](templates/) index. The canonical design
text is [`src/agent_composer/README.md`](../../../src/agent_composer/README.md);
the authoring surface is [`docs/syntax.md`](../../../docs/syntax.md).

## The node contract (the most portable idea)

A node is a **pure function of its bound input record**. It implements
`run(inputs, **caps) -> NodeResult` and returns ONE of the closed sum:

| Return | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Output(value)` | the one produced value; the engine writes it under the node id. Optional `Output(value, commit_as=<id>)` redirects the write to another id (and fires *that* id's out-edges) — the node-chosen commit target; `None` (the default) commits under the node's own id. |
| `Route(handle)` | a routing-only outcome (a CASE picks an out-edge `handle`); carries no value, writes no pool entry. The engine emits `NodeRouted` and takes the chosen edge, skip-flooding the siblings. |
| `Pause(reason)` | a leaf wait (HUMAN_INPUT / WAIT / agent control-pause). The engine emits `PauseRequested` and suspends; the answer is delivered as this node's `Output` (the node never re-runs). |
| `Grow(subgraph, prune, seed)` | grow the live graph — a self-describing `Subgraph` the engine splices in generically via `_apply_grow` (the CALL/MAP drivers, agent control-pause, loop iterations). `seed` is the pure builder input persisted for durable replay; `prune` names ids to retire in the same step. Only spawner kinds (`is_spawner`) may return it. |

A streaming kind is a generator that yields `StreamChunk` and *returns* a
`NodeResult`. **Failure is not a variant** — a node `raise`s and the engine
boundary turns it into `NodeFailed`; a node may override `on_failure(exc,
inputs, **caps) -> NodeResult` to recover (default re-raises).

**Invariants:** a node never receives the pool (the `eval_node` seam binds its
inputs); a node never writes the pool (it *describes* `Output(value)`, the engine
performs the write). Keeps nodes pure and the state immutable (`let`-bindings).

**Capabilities (`caps`)** are the narrow, engine-owned effect providers passed as keyword
args to `run` — the node never imports them itself. Each is gated by a node trait so a node
receives only what it declares: a mapped `call` gets `caps['bind_item']` (per-element bind,
gated on `binds_per_item`); an LLM-backed node (`agent`) gets `caps['llm']` — the
`model_from_config`-shaped model factory the engine owns (`FlowEngine.llm`, defaulting to a
lazy package-lookup thunk), gated on `needs_llm`. The node builds its chat model from that
provider instead of importing the factory.

## Node-owned traits/hooks (how the core stays kind-blind)

The engine core reads these node members instead of branching on `node.kind`. Defaults sit on the
base `Node`; a kind overrides only what it needs.

| Member | Where the core reads it | Default → overrides |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| `binds_per_item: bool` | read boundary (`eval_node`): bind PER ELEMENT via a `bind_item` cap vs bind `params` once | `False` → `True` on `map` |
| `bind_reserved(wiring, pool) -> dict` | read boundary: reserved keys pre-resolved into the record before `run` | `{}` → timed `wait` `{"until": ts}`, `map` `{"over": [...]}` |
| `iter_boundary_records(seed) -> [(record,label)]` | growth core (`_apply_grow`): records eager-checked against the child's boundary asserts *before* the ledger attach | `[]` → `call` one, `map` one/element (agent/loop none) |
| `grow_depth_delta: int\|None` | growth core: REF-depth increment stamped on the spliced spawners + terminal (positive bounded by `MAX_REF_DEPTH`) | `None` (loop/non-REF, no depth work) → `1` call/map, `0` agent |
| `grow_restamps_self: bool` | growth core: also stamp `_spawner_expansion` at the spawner's OWN bare id (re-pause nesting) | `False` → `True` on `agent` |
| `is_loop: bool` | growth core: gate the loop-only per-iteration bookkeeping (live index + single-live-record invariant) | `False` → `True` on `loop` |
| `needs_llm: bool` | read boundary (`eval_node`): build the `caps['llm']` cap (the engine-owned model factory) and pass it to `run` | `False` → `True` on `agent` |

The rest of the splice (add subgraph, enforce `MAX_TOTAL_NODES`, mint one uniform `GrowRecord`,
finish/mark the spawner, apply the origin `commit_as` to the derived terminal, schedule roots) is
uniform. The old per-kind `_grow_*_residual` switch is gone. Success-path routing (CASE branch/skip,
subflow commit-under-spawner) rides `Outcome` data (`Route.handle`, `Output.commit_as`); a spawner's
`post_asserts` are re-checked at the **commit site** when a terminal commits under a different id —
not rehomed onto the terminal.

## `NodeKind` (closed vocabulary)

`NodeKind` is a closed enum (no registry/metaclass), but the engine **core does not dispatch on
it** — `runtime/engine.py` + `runtime/eval_node.py` branch only on the closed `Outcome` sum and on
node-owned traits/hooks (below). Any kind-specific `match` lives in a node's own `run`. A ratchet
test (`tests/engine/test_kind_census.py`) holds the core's `NodeKind`/`*Expansion` dispatch count
at 0.

| Authorable leaves | Internal-only (loader-synthesized / runtime-expanded) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `AGENT`, `CODE`, `MODEL`*, `TOOL`, `CASE` (the `case` node kind), `HUMAN_INPUT` | `START`, `END`, `CALL`, `MAP`, `LOOP`, `WAIT` (reserved) |

\* `MODEL` parses but `run` raises — the ML-serving seam was removed as dead
plumbing; re-add when real serving lands.

## OCaml analogue map (design from this)

| Our construct | OCaml concept | Why it holds |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| a flow | a function `'a -> 'b` | typed in, typed out; composes |
| an agent | a flow whose leaf is an LLM loop | no special contract |
| `call:` / `uses:` | function application / a module ref | nests to any depth |
| the variable pool bind | `let (node_id, key) = ...` | immutable, no mutation |
| `NodeKind` + `match` | a variant + exhaustive `match` | closed set, no registry; but the CORE matches on `Outcome`/traits, not on kind |
| `Output \| Route \| Pause \| Grow` | a sum type (the result) | failure is a `raise`, not a case |
| pause / resume | algebraic effect + handler | node *performs* a pause; the scheduler *handles* it |
| a package charter (`__init__`) | a module signature (`.mli`) | a narrow declared interface |

When borrowing runtime mechanics from a prior worker engine: **borrow** the
correctness-critical parts (single-writer dispatcher, 3-state edge join,
outputs-before-successors, recursive skip-flood, layered checkpoint, discriminated
pause reasons); **drop** scale/framework baggage (external DBs, dynamic worker
scaling, plugin registries, heavy layering, multi-tenancy).

## Non-negotiable invariants (the keep/simplify/drop bar)

A change is a design smell if it breaks any of these — most are the functional
model made enforceable.

- **Deterministic structure** — the author fixes the call graph; the LLM fills
  leaf boxes. A flow never rewrites itself. No agentic routing.
- **A flow is a function** — explicit typed input/output signature; an agent gets
  no special contract.
- **Composable / recursive** — a node can *be* a flow (`call:`/`uses:`), nestable
  to any depth. Never assume a node is a leaf; preserve recursion through
  compile + run + checkpoint.
- **Privileges no output type or domain** — prefer the most general primitive that
  composes over a use-case-specific feature.
- **Node never writes the pool** (purity); **typed, losslessly-serializable state**
  (`Segment` / `TypedVariablePool` — the basis for checkpoints + `${...}` refs).
- **Durable suspend/resume** — a node performs a pause; the run serializes to a
  `RunCheckpoint`; an external scheduler resumes (re-run-on-resume). The checkpoint
  carries `num_workers` (the drive mode), and both `run()` and `resume()` drive
  through the shared `_drive_to_terminal` — so `resume()` is drive-mode-aware:
  `FlowEngine.restore(flow, ckpt)` rebuilds at the checkpointed count, and
  `restore(..., num_workers=N)` (also `resume_flow(..., num_workers=N)`) overrides it.
  A run checkpointed serial can resume pooled and vice-versa (correctness is
  worker-count-independent).
- **Dependency-light core** — no DB / heavy frameworks; external capabilities enter
  through injected seams (plain callables). *Exception:* the AGENT node imports
  langchain + `llm_clients` and builds its model via `model_from_config`.
- **`llm_config` cascade resolved once at run start** — `resolve_llm_cascade`
  (`compile/`) walks the static call tree top-down, per-field fill-the-gap
  (most-specific wins), deep-copying each CALL/MAP child for per-callsite isolation,
  and bakes the effective dict onto every `AgentNode`. The CLI config is the outermost
  layer; env defaults stay in `model_from_config` (applied last). On a **durable resume
  it must run BEFORE `FlowEngine.restore`** — restore's replay re-clones children from
  the static graph, so the effective configs must be baked on first.
- **Closed `NodeKind`; the core is kind-blind** — `NodeKind` stays a closed enum, but the engine
  core dispatches on `Outcome` + node-owned traits/hooks, never on `node.kind` (ratchet: census 0).
  **single-writer** (workers are pure
  executors, the dispatcher is the only mutator); **single-process CLI target**.
- **AGENT structured output** — a non-text `output:` Shape switches an agent from text
  producer to structured generation: `shape_to_schema` (`nodes/agent/structured.py`)
  derives a pydantic schema, the mode generates a conforming value (native
  `with_structured_output`, or a JSON prompt-injection fallback gated by
  `supports_native_structured(provider, model)`), with `retries:`-capped self-correction.
  Three-part contract: **generate-tries** (the schema asks), **boundary-enforces**
  (`pool.set(..., declared=output_shape)` validates — on both the primary path and a
  resumed agent's `commit_as`-redirect path), **retry-catches** (a deviation is fed back and
  re-asked). A bare `str`/`Literal[...]` keeps the text path.

## Layer ladder (where code goes)

```
events  <-  state  <-  nodes  <-  compile  <-  compose  <-  runtime  ->  suspension
                        ^   ^
            expr  ──────┘   └──────  llm_clients     (both leaves, imported by nodes upward)
```

Arrows never reverse: a package imports only lower-level or peer packages. See the
`structure` skill. An upward import means the code is in the wrong package (extract
the shared contract to `common.py` / a leaf, or invert via a seam).

## The `expr` layer (one grammar, everywhere `${...}` appears)

Bindings, conditions, and prompts share ONE expression grammar — the three
divergent dialects the engine grew (binding coalesce/default, `when:`
boolean/arithmetic, prompt builtin-call) are unified. Three modules, one pipeline
(parse → AST → evaluate / ref-walk):

- **`grammar.py` — parse only.** `parse_expr` compiles a span into a Lark tree
  (arithmetic `+ - * / % **`, comparisons, `and`/`or`/`not`, `in`/`not in`, list
  literals, pure builtin calls with dotted access, `:-` default / `:?` required /
  `|` coalesce). No evaluation here. The evaluator walks this **restricted AST** —
  there is no Python `eval`; a builtin call resolves only against the
  `TEMPLATE_FNS` whitelist, so a span can compute but cannot reach arbitrary code.
- **`expressions.py` — evaluate + ref-walk.** `eval_expr` walks the tree over a
  resolver; `expr_refs` collects the reference paths a span reads (the compile-time
  companion, for edge inference + scope checks); `evaluate_when` is the `when:`
  boolean. `RequiredError` (a `${x:?"msg"}` over an unbound ref) lives here, its
  natural home now that the evaluator raises it.
- **`template.py` — the string surface.** `scan_template` splits literal text from
  `${...}` spans; `eval_binding` renders a binding value; `render_template_record`
  renders a strict prompt; `$$` is the scanner's universal escape (a prompt `$$`
  renders a single `$`).

**Three resolve modes** decide what a MISSING reference does, one per context:
`BINDING_NONE` (a binding → `None`, so `|`/`:-` can coalesce), `CONDITION_FALSY`
(a `when:` → falsy), `STRICT_RAISE` (a prompt → raise; no silent blank).

**`call(...)` desugar — a flow call is NOT an expression.** A child-flow call is a
compile-time directive recognized at TWO sites, by ONE whole-value rule (only the
entire trimmed value, never embedded in a span): a binding's whole value, and a
`case` `then:`/`else:` target. At load it desugars into an anonymous `call` node
(`__call_N`) and the host is rewritten to `${<synth>.output}`. A flow call inside
a span (`${flow(args)}`) is a hard `LoadError` — hoist an embedded call to a named
node; a coalesce-of-calls (`${a() | b()}`) is likewise rejected. Pure builtins
(`${upper(x)}`) stay legal inside `${}`.

**Raw-string public API** (what callers outside `expr` use, re-exported from the
`expr` package `__init__`): `eval_binding` (render a binding), `expr_refs_of` (its
reference paths), `evaluate_when` (a condition), plus `render_template_record` /
`prompt_refs` for prompts. Two families back the reference walkers. Extraction:
`expr_refs_of` reads only `${...}` spans (bindings, templates, prompts), while
`condition_refs` parses a WHOLE expression (a `when:`/`on:`/loop predicate/assert
written bare, mixed, or whole-span) so the bare spelling's refs are seen — using
the template walker on a bare condition finds nothing. Rewriting (spelling-
preserving, for the `case` desugar): `rewrite_expr_refs` / `rewrite_template_refs`
(span walkers) and `rewrite_condition_refs` (whole-expression). Callers pass
source strings + a resolver; they never touch the grammar or AST.

## Located errors (precise source lines)

A runtime failure points at the **exact YAML line** it originates from, not just the
node header. The mechanism is a structured locator produced at the failure site and
resolved to a line at the CLI boundary — never a text heuristic.

- **`SourceSpan(node, kind, key)`** (in `events`, the leaf) — `kind ∈ {input, assert,
  input_decl, field}`; `key` is the input name / assert expr / input-decl name / field
  name; `node` is the node id, or `None` for a flow-level location.
- **Carriers:** `NodeFailed.locator` (node-level) and `RunFailed.locator` /
  `RunResult.locator` (flow-level). All default `None`.
- **Producers:** `BindingError` stamps a node-less `input` span (`bind_params` knows the
  param name, not the node); `eval_node`'s funnel fills the node id via `replace(loc,
  node=node.id)` and emits an `assert` span at each of its three node-assert yields;
  `StartNode.run` stamps an `input_decl` span on the e08 `SegmentError`; the engine's
  seed step and `run.py` stamp `assert` spans for boundary / post-terminal asserts; the
  engine's typed write boundary stamps a `field` span (`key="output"`) on the
  `NodeExecutionError` it raises when a node's value fails its declared `output:` Shape.
- **Resolution:** the parser's sub-line maps (`node_input_lines`, `node_field_lines`,
  `assert_lines`, `input_decl_lines`) map a span to a 1-based line; the CLI's `_locate`
  + fallback chain (precise line → node-kind best field, e.g. a code node's `code:` →
  node header → plain message) boxes it.
- **Cross-flow call traceback** — when a failure is inside a *called child*, its node id is
  runtime-NAMESPACED (`gate/approve`, `outer/via/boom`, `gate#0/inner` for a map element).
  A `call`/`map` node bakes its child flow's render-only **`SourceFrame`** (`compose/loader`:
  label + source text + node→line / field→line maps) onto `child_source` at load — for a
  `defs:` child the text is the PARENT file (inner nodes at their absolute parent lines, via
  `def_node_lines`); for an external `uses:` child it is that file's own text, label = its
  filename. The frame is frozen and `__deepcopy__`-returns-self, so `clone_child`'s per-callsite
  deep-copy shares the one instance and it is exempt from the node-purity scan (it carries raw
  `${...}` YAML, but is metadata, not a wiring source). At error time `cli/run.py:_walk_call_frames`
  splits the namespaced id and walks segment-by-segment through the baked IR
  (`node.child`/`node.child_source`), collecting one frame per level; `_render_run_error` boxes
  them stacked, most-recent-call-last (Python-traceback style), falling back to the single-frame
  box when fewer than two frames resolve. A frame title names WHERE it lives: a top/external file
  frame is the filename alone, a `defs:` frame is filename-qualified (`<file> defs:<name>`) since
  its nodes physically live in that file.

## Design-note template (step 3 of the workflow)

Before coding any engine change, write this short note and confirm any non-obvious
choice (CLAUDE.md "ask when uncertain"):

```
Construct:    <name> — what it consumes -> what it produces (its type signature)
OCaml analogue: <the concept you're borrowing> — how it maps to nodes/pool/runtime
Keep / drop:  <what you borrow from prior engines; what scale baggage you drop>
Lands in:     <layer/package on the ladder>  (new package? write its charter)
Seam:         <injected callable, if it touches an external dependency> | none
Invariants:   <which of the non-negotiables it touches; how it stays within them>
Tests:        <the tests/engine cases that will prove it>
```
