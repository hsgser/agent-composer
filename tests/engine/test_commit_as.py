"""`commit_as` lives on the three coordinated carriers — the field itself.

P2 replaces the engine's `alias`/`loop_alias` redirect dicts with a `commit_as` field
that travels on the node/Output/event. This test pins the field's presence and defaults
on all three homes (the engine wiring is exercised by the expansion/loop/durable tests).
