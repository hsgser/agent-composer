"""The generic `_apply_grow` core splices a self-describing `Flow`.

Drives `FlowEngine._apply_grow` directly with a tiny one-node child `Flow` (a leaf carrying a
baked `commit_as`), asserting the generic core's contract: the node is spliced into `flow.nodes`,
registered in the state manager, and its `start_id` scheduled. The spawner stand-in is a plain
`FuncNode` carrying the default node traits (`grow_depth_delta=None`, `is_loop=False`,
`grow_restamps_self=False`), so the trait-driven growth bookkeeping is a no-op — the core's
splice/register/schedule/prune contract is exercised in isolation."""
