"""F1 — a SPAWNER (CALL/MAP) nested inside a LOOP body durably resumes.

The existing durable-loop coverage parks on a `human_input` LEAF inside a loop body
(`test_durable_replay.test_durable_loop_resumes_on_fresh_flow`) and on a loop nested
inside a CALL (`test_nested_loop_in_call_*`). This file closes the missing direction:
a CALL / MAP spawner nested *inside* a dynamically-grown loop iteration, paused mid-body
and resumed both in-process and across a durable checkpoint hop. If the generic growth
splice stamps nested spawners uniformly, this "falls out for free"; these tests are the
proof.
