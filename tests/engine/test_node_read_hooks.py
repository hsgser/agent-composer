"""Node-owned read hooks — `bind_reserved` / `binds_per_item`.

The read boundary's reserved-input resolution (timed WAIT `until`, MAP `over`) lives on the
node, not in a `node.kind == ...` branch in `eval_node`. These tests pin the hook contract per
kind: a timed WAIT resolves `until`; MAP declares per-item binding and resolves `over` to a list;
an ordinary node reserves nothing and binds up front.
