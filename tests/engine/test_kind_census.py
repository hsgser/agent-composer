"""Kind-dispatch census — a ratchet that guards the kind-agnostic refactor.

The engine is being migrated so that its core (`runtime/engine.py` + `runtime/eval_node.py`)
knows only an abstract node contract and a closed `Outcome` sum — it must NOT branch on a node's
`NodeKind` nor on a concrete `*Expansion` type. This test *counts* the remaining kind-dispatch
sites and asserts the count never rises above a recorded ceiling.

Each refactor phase lowers `BASELINE`; the final phase drives it to `0`. The count is derived
from the source (self-calibrating) rather than a hand-maintained line list, so it survives
line-number drift — only the ceiling constant moves.

A "kind-dispatch site" is a distinct source line that does any of:
  - reference a `NodeKind` member  (`NodeKind.AGENT`, `NodeKind.CASE`, ...)   -> branches on kind
  - reference `_SPAWNER_KINDS`      (the spawner-kind set used for membership) -> branches on kind
  - call `isinstance(x, <...>Expansion)`                                       -> branches on concrete type

Import lines are excluded (importing `NodeKind` / `_SPAWNER_KINDS` is not dispatch), and a
diagnostic read like `node.kind.value` (for an error message) is not counted — it touches the
instance attribute, not a `NodeKind` member or an `*Expansion` type.

Known blind spots (do NOT route dispatch through these to dodge the ratchet — none exist in the
core today, and reintroducing kind dispatch in one of these shapes defeats the whole refactor):
indirect enum access (`getattr(NodeKind, name)`, `NodeKind[name]`, `NodeKind(value)`), a
`match node.kind` / `case NodeKind.X` block, kind-keyed dispatch dicts built off-file, and
type-name string compares (`type(desc).__name__ == "CallExpansion"`). The `*Expansion` detection
is a name-suffix heuristic tied to the codebase convention that every expansion type ends in
`Expansion`; keep that convention so the census stays accurate.

# COEXISTED with the legacy `_apply_enqueue`/`_grow_*` replay path + the `*Expansion` union
# isinstance dispatch. P3.5 unified the durability ledger to a single `GrowRecord` and made
# replay kind-blind: the `*Expansion` union + its isinstance dispatch and the legacy
# `_grow_call`/`_grow_map`/`_grow_agent` replay bodies are gone, dropping the ceiling to 13.
# P3.6 deleted `Enqueue`/`_apply_enqueue` (LOOP turn-0 now returns `Grow`) and swapped the 3
# `_SPAWNER_KINDS` residual stamps + the `eval_node` def for the kind-blind `node.is_spawner`,
# dropping the ceiling to 8.
# P5.1 moved the two `eval_node` read-boundary reads (MAP over-mode, WAIT timed) behind the
# node-owned `bind_reserved`/`binds_per_item` hooks, dropping the ceiling to 6.
# The 6 that remain are all deleted in P5.2-P5.4: the `_grow_residual` kind dispatch (4 arms,
# engine.py) + the CALL post-assert check (engine.py), plus 1 eval_node site (END post-assert).)
