"""`case` `then:/else: call(...)` inline-call branch targets.

A branch target may be an inline call (a fresh owned call) instead of a placed node id; it
desugars to a synth `__call_<n>` node and the then:/else: is rewritten to that synth id. Sound
because the case veto skip-floods the non-chosen synth branch. Accepted grammar: a whole-value
`call(...)` directive (a route target is one node id); the retired inline `${flow(args)}` span
target is a LoadError.
