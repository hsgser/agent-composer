"""A named `call` node whose `.output` a flow `asserts:` expression reads.

A flow-level post assert can reference any node's output, including a named `call`
node's: `dbl_call` runs the `dbl` def, and `${dbl_call.output} >= 0` is classified
post and checked after the run. No synth node is minted — the call is an ordinary,
author-named node in the flow.
