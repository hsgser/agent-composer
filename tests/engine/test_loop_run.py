"""End-to-end `while:` loop runs (Ollama-free, pure-CODE body).

The loop carries `{n, exited}`, runs the body `bump` (`{n, exited} -> {n: n+1, exited: n+1>=3}`)
while `not ${exited}`, and terminates when the predicate goes false. Covers the multi-iteration
happy path, the turn-0 (0-iteration) case (seed already satisfies exit), the max-exceeded
runaway guard, and the error boundary — a `while:` predicate that raises at runtime and a
node-budget blowup both become failed runs, never uncaught escapes.

Loop model (self-respawn, no engine `_loop_step`): each iteration is a fresh `LoopNode` driver
clone. `L` is the compiled loop id (iteration 0); `L~k` is the fresh driver clone for iteration
`k >= 1`; `L#k/…` is the cloned body namespace for iteration `k`. A driver's `run` decides
continue-vs-stop: STOP returns `Output(carried, commit_as=L)` (generic commit under `L`);
CONTINUE emits a `Grow` splicing `body_k` + a fresh `L~(k+1)` driver, self-pruning the previous
body and (except the origin) itself. The CONTINUE body-END carries NO `commit_as` — it feeds the
next driver by plain wiring.
