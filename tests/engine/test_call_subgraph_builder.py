"""The pure CALL builder `call_subgraph` — pins its output to the CALL residual's clone shape.

`call_subgraph(child, callsite, record)` wraps `clone_child`, bakes `commit_as=callsite` on the
cloned child END filler, and returns a `Flow` (the self-describing fragment a CALL spawner grows
into). This test pins: `start_id` is the namespaced child START; the terminal (`end_id`) is the
namespaced child END carrying `commit_as == callsite`; and every node id is `ns`-prefixed under the
callsite.
