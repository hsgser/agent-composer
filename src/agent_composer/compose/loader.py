"""The top-level loader: Compose YAML text -> a runnable `LoadedFlow`.

The integration that wires every prior slice into one `CompiledFlow`. The
post-parse pipeline is `_assemble`, shared by the top-level flow AND every in-file
`defs:` callable:

  parse -> typedefs registry -> [build defs] -> flow-input decls -> build
  leaf nodes + desugar cases -> infer data edges -> reconcile case edges
  -> validate references + classify asserts -> synthesize roots/terminals over
  ALL edges -> reject cycles + check if/else handles -> CompiledFlow.from_parts.

`call` resolution is **defs-first**: a `call:` names an in-file `defs:` callable (built
in-loader by the same `_assemble`) or, failing that, an external flow via the
injected `child_resolver` (`(flow_id, version) -> LoadedFlow`). `_make_call_resolver`
composes the two (and rejects recursive/mutual defs). `call` nodes are resolved-and-baked
at load: the loader derives the callable's signature (a plain call re-exports the single
codomain `Type`; a mapped call stamps `list[<codomain>]`; bindings are name/arity- and
type-checked against it) AND bakes the callable's compiled flow onto the built
`CallNode` so `run` drives the embedded child. A flow whose `call`s are all
in-file defs loads resolver-free; a `call` to a non-def callable without a resolver is
loud. `run_flow` stays resolver-free.

The flow `outputs:` section is mapped to `FlowOutput(name, from_)` carriers the way
`runtime.engine.terminal_output` consumes them: a name -> binding map keeps each name; a
bare whole-string binding (`${note.output}`) is one output named `result` (so
`len(outputs) == 1` -> `terminal_output` returns the bare resolved value).

Imports flow DOWN only: this module composes the compose package's own slices plus
`state`/`compile.model`; nothing in the engine imports it back.
