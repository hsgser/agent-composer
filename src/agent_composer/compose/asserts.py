"""`asserts:` parse + compile-validate + boundary/post-terminal classify.

A flow's `asserts:` is a list of boolean checks in the `when:`/`asserts:` grammar
(comparisons + `and`/`or`/`not` + arithmetic + `in`). Each enforces an invariant; a false
one fails the run. This module is the COMPILE-TIME half: it parses each assert, validates
every `${...}` reference it reads (reusing the leaf checker `compile.validation._classify_path`
— a dangling node/input or a bad record field is a loud `LoadError`), and CLASSIFIES each
assert by which side it constrains:

- a `${input.X}` / `${system.X}`-only assert -> **boundary**: it depends only on the run
  arguments + ambients, so it can fire BEFORE any node runs (fail-fast).
- an assert that reads ANY `${<id>.output[.X]}` -> **post-terminal**: it depends on a
  produced value, so it can only fire AFTER the run reaches a terminal.

This module does NOT run the asserts — `run_flow` evaluates each split against the
appropriate pool via `expr.evaluate_when`. Here we just parse, validate, and split.

Imports flow DOWN only: `compile.validation` (the leaf `_classify_path`), `expr`
(the grammar parse-check), `state.segments` (Shape, for typing). Nothing imports this back.
