"""`run_flow(loaded, inputs) -> RunResult` — the run entrypoint.

A host-agnostic run boundary that drives a loaded `LoadedFlow` through the
`FlowEngine` and enforces its `asserts:` in two phases. It owns the run-input
concerns the pure graph engine doesn't:

- coerce + default the run arguments against the flow's `InputDecl`s,
- seed the `input` namespace + the host-ambient `system` clock,
- fire the BOUNDARY asserts (`${input}`/`${system}`-only) BEFORE any node runs
  (fail-fast), and the POST-TERMINAL asserts (`${<id>.output}`) AFTER the run
  reaches a terminal — flipping a succeeded run to `failed` on a false post assert.

`RunResult` (the surface-agnostic run outcome) lives here, beside `run_flow`. The
seeding fns (`coerce_inputs`/`apply_defaults`/`seed_system_clock`) come from
`typesys.seeding`; the run's clock is the `${system.today}`/`${system.now}` ambients
(a flow reads "as of" via `Optional[date]` + `:-`/`${system.today}`).

Never raises on a flow failure — a failed/aborted run, or a false assert, comes back as
a `RunResult` with `status != "succeeded"` (RunFailed is an engine EVENT, not an
exception). Compile-time errors (a bad flow) are surfaced by `load_flow`, not here.

Imports flow DOWN only: `runtime` (FlowEngine), `typesys` (the pool + seeding),
`expr` (evaluate_when), `events`, and the sibling `loader` (LoadedFlow). Nothing
imports back.

    The outcome of one flow run (or resume) — surface-agnostic.

    Returned by [`run_flow`][agent_composer.run_flow] and
    [`resume_flow`][agent_composer.compose.run.resume_flow] for every terminal,
    including failures and pauses; these functions never raise on a flow failure.

    Attributes:
        input (`dict[str, Any]`):
            The coerced run-argument dict (singular, for symmetry across surfaces).
            Empty `{}` on a resume, which carries no fresh run arguments.
        status (`str`):
            The terminal state: one of `"succeeded"`, `"failed"`, `"paused"`, or
            `"aborted"`.
        output (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The flow's single terminal value — a scalar or a multi-field object.
            Set only when `status == "succeeded"`.
        error (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Human-readable failure detail. Set only when `status == "failed"`
            (including a false post-terminal assert).
        locator (`SourceSpan`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The precise YAML sub-location a flow-level failure originates from — a false
            post-terminal/boundary assert expr, or a boundary input-coercion error. Set only
            when `status == "failed"` AND no `NodeFailed` carries the location (a node-level
            failure puts its locator on the `NodeFailed` event instead). The CLI resolves it
            to a 1-based source line.
        events (`list[Any]`):
            The raw engine event objects, in emission order. A host serializes them
            however it sees fit.
        checkpoint (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            A serializable `RunCheckpoint` for durable, cross-process resume. Set
            only when `status == "paused"`.
        engine (`FlowEngine`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The live engine for fast in-process resume. Set only when
            `status == "paused"`.
        pause_reasons (`list[Any]`):
            The self-addressing `PauseReason`s to act on before resuming. Non-empty
            only when `status == "paused"`.

    Coerce inputs, seed the variable pool, enforce asserts, and drive the flow to a terminal.

    Never raises on a flow failure: a failed, paused, or aborted run is returned as a
    `RunResult` with a non-`"succeeded"` status (a `RunFailed` is an engine event, not an
    exception). Compile-time errors of a bad flow surface earlier, in
    [`load_flow`][agent_composer.load_flow]. Asserts run in two phases — boundary asserts
    (`${input}`/`${system}`-only) fire *before* any node runs and return `status="failed"`
    on a false one; post-terminal asserts (`${<id>.output}`) run *after* the flow reaches a
    terminal and flip an otherwise-succeeded run to `"failed"`.

    Args:
        loaded (`LoadedFlow`):
            A compiled, validated flow from [`load_flow`][agent_composer.load_flow].
            Carries the IR, the declared input schema, and the assert sets.
        inputs (`dict[str, Any]`):
            Run arguments keyed by declared input name. Each value is coerced to its
            declared type; names omitted here fall back to their declared defaults.
        run_id (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Host-injected run id, readable in the flow as `${system.run_id}`. When
            `None`, a fresh id is minted per run.
        on_event (`Callable[[Any], None]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Called with each engine event as it occurs (`NodeStarted`, `RunSucceeded`,
            `RunPaused`, `RunFailed`, `RunAborted`). Use it for progress reporting.
        llm_config (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Outermost cascade layer (CLI `--provider`/`--model`); fills only the gaps a
            flow leaves unset, then `model_from_config` applies env/global defaults.
        num_workers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `0`):
            Engine drive mode. `0` is the single-threaded inline drain (deterministic
            event order); `>=1` spawns a worker pool of that size so independent ready
            nodes (a fan-out) run concurrently. The result is worker-count-independent.

    Returns:
        `RunResult`:
            The run outcome. `status` is one of `"succeeded"`, `"failed"`, `"paused"`,
            or `"aborted"`; `output` is set on success, and `pause_reasons` plus the
            resume handles (`engine`, `checkpoint`) are set on a pause.

        ```python
        from agent_composer import load_flow, run_flow
