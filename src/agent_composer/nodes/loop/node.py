"""LoopNode — the self-respawning `while:`/`until:`/`times:` driver.

Each loop iteration is a FRESH `LoopNode` driver clone whose `run` owns the WHOLE loop policy —
the continue-vs-stop decision, the iteration index, the runaway guard, and the self-respawn grow.
There is no engine-side loop step: the engine core stays kind-blind (splice `Grow`, apply
`prune`, commit `Output`, fold the durable ledger).

Names:
  L      the COMPILED loop node id (iteration-0 driver, `origin_id == L == self.id`).
  L~k    a fresh driver clone for iteration `k >= 1` (`iteration=k`, `origin_id=L`, id `f"{L}~{k}"`).
  L#k/…  the cloned body for iteration `k` at callsite `map_callsite(L, k)` == `f"{L}#{k}"`.

Per-iteration (driver@k = `L` when k==0 else `L~k`, run on the carried record):
  STOP → `Output(carried, commit_as=origin)` — generic commit-and-advance under `L`.
  CONT → `Grow(subgraph = {body_k (NO commit_as), L~(k+1) driver, edge body_k.END→L~(k+1),
         driver wiring}, prune = {body_{k-1} ids} ∪ ({self.id} if self.id != origin), seed=(carried, k))`.

BOTH `run` (on `L~k`) and `replay_grow` (on `L`) build body/driver at the ORIGIN callsite
(`self.origin_id`), never `self.id`, so live and durable-replay windows are byte-identical.
