"""CALL — the REF driver (`kind: call`), internal-only build target.

`CallNode` applies a callable ONCE (`'a flow -> 'b`). It is the REF half of the REF/MAP pair;
the MAP half is `nodes.map.MapNode` (`kind: map` + `over:`, `list['a] -> list['b]`) — the two are
distinct typed drivers. `CallNode` carries NO `over`/`parallel`.

`run` returns one `Grow(Subgraph)` — self-describing expansion: it builds the child subgraph
(`call_subgraph`) and the engine's generic `_apply_grow` splices it into the live graph, with a
per-kind CALL residual (depth/refdepth/finish-mark + the transitional boundary-assert/ledger). The
`Grow.seed` is the raw call-arg record (the durable builder input). The spliced child
START_ID owns omitted-input defaulting (its params carry default/required), so the driver no longer
pre-defaults. `child`/`child_inputs`/`child_asserts` are baked at load by
`compose.build` (`build_call_node`); `child_inputs` is read by compile validation
(`check_ref_map_types`) AND at runtime by the engine's boundary-assert temp pool (to mirror START_ID's
coerce+default view for the eager `${input.X}` check).

    The REF driver (`kind: call`) — apply a callable flow once (`'a flow -> 'b`).

    The REF half of the REF/MAP pair (the MAP half is
    [`MapNode`][agent_composer.nodes.map.node.MapNode]). `run` returns one `Grow(Subgraph)`
    description; the engine's generic `_apply_grow` splices the built child subgraph and grows the
    live graph. The spliced
    child START owns omitted-input defaulting, so the driver passes call-args raw.

    Args:
        node_id (`str`):
            The node's unique id.
        flow_id (`str`):
            The id of the child flow to call.
        flow_version (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            A pinned child flow version, if any.
        child (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The baked child flow (stamped at load); a `None` child raises at run time.
        child_inputs (`list`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The child's input decls, read by compile validation and the boundary-assert temp pool.
        child_asserts (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The child's baked boundary asserts.
        child_source (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The child flow's render-only `SourceFrame` (label + node-line maps). Carried
            for the CLI's nested-error traceback only; `run` ignores it entirely.
        title (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Display title.
