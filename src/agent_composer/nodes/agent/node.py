"""AGENT node — one node configured by `mode` + `tools` + `controls`, entered two ways.

Three knobs:
- **mode** (`AgentBody.mode`) — *how* it runs: the loop / prompting method, one of
  the registered `MODES` (`plain` = a single call, `tool_calling` = a loop, later
  `react`). Pick one.
- **tools** (`AgentBody.tools`) — ordinary tools (from `agent_composer.tools`, e.g.
  `web_search`, data fetchers) a mode may call. (`plain` ignores them;
  `tool_calling` binds and loops over them.)
- **controls** (`AgentBody.controls`) — *control tools* (from `nodes/agent/controls/`,
  e.g. `ask_user`) that drive an engine effect when called, like suspending the run.

**Entry — the algebraic-effect split (`entry: Fresh | Resume`).** An AGENT node is
entered one of two ways, a closed two-variant sum:

- `Fresh(prompt)` — the author's agent: render the prompt against the node's declared
  inputs and start a new conversation; the selected `mode` runs the loop.
- `Resume(memo, iterations, pending)` — the **delimited continuation** of an `ask_user`
  control pause: rebuild the conversation from `memo`, append the human `answer` (its
  sole declared input) as the `ToolMessage` matching `pending["call_id"]`, then continue
  the loop. Minted only by the engine's continuation cloner (`clone_continuation_pair`);
  never authored. The re-entry frame rides as node DATA, not the pool — that is what
  keeps the resume entry self-contained and lets the closed-kind law hold with no exception.

A fresh agent and a resumed agent share the loop body (`agent_step`) but are DIFFERENT
typed arrows — `declared_inputs -> NodeResult` vs `answer -> NodeResult` — so the
distinction is an internal variant matched in `run`, NOT a second `NodeKind` (one closed
`kind = AGENT`).

The node builds its chat model from the engine-injected `caps['llm']` provider (a
`model_from_config`-shaped factory the engine owns; gated by the `needs_llm` trait) and hands
the mode the prompt rendered against its **declared inputs** (strict AGENT — the prompt sees
only `${name}` bound inputs, not the pool), the tools/controls, and the model. The engine
imports an LLM SDK by design — the old "engine imports no LLM SDK" rule was dropped;
a mode talks to langchain directly.

    An LLM-backed node, configured by `mode` + `tools` + `controls` and entered two ways.

    A `Fresh` entry renders `prompt` against the node's declared inputs and runs the selected
    `mode`'s loop; a `Resume` entry is the delimited continuation of an `ask_user` control pause
    (see the module docstring for the entry split). The node builds its chat model from the
    engine-injected `caps['llm']` provider (using `llm_config` as the carrier) and gives the mode
    the rendered prompt, tools, and controls.

    Args:
        node_id (`str`):
            The node's unique id.
        entry (`AgentEntry`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The `Fresh | Resume` entry. `None` builds a `Fresh` from `prompt` (the author path).
        prompt (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
            The author prompt, used only when `entry` is `None`.
        tools (`list[str]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Ordinary tool ids the mode may call (resolved from `agent_composer.tools`).
        controls (`list[str]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Control-tool ids (e.g. `ask_user`) that drive an engine effect.
        llm_config (`dict`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Plain-dict model selection (normalized to `LLMConfig` by `model_from_config`).
            On construction this is the node's OWN authored config; `resolve_llm_cascade`
            later overwrites `self.llm_config` with the EFFECTIVE config (own gap-filled by
            the flow/parent/CLI layers). The authored source is kept on `own_llm_config`.
        llm_inherit (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whole-node cascade opt-out. `False` (authored as `llm_config: {inherit: false}`)
            makes the effective config the node's own dict only — no flow/parent/CLI layers.
        mode (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"plain"`):
            The loop method; must be a registered mode.
        retries (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `2`):
            Structured-generation self-correction cap — extra attempts after the first when
            the node declares a non-text `output:` and the provider deviates from the schema.
            Authorable as `retries:` on the node.
        title (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Display title.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `mode` is unknown or a control id is not registered.
