"""MAP — the `List.map` driver (`kind: map` + `over:`), internal-only build target.

`MapNode` is the mapped-call node, distinct from REF's `CallNode`. The two are different typed
drivers: a `CallNode` applies a callable ONCE (`'a flow -> 'b`); a `MapNode` maps it over a
list (`list['a] -> list['b]`). The discriminator is the KIND (`NodeKind.MAP`) — `MapNode` carries
NO `over` attribute and no `${...}` source on the node. The `over` SOURCE binding rides
`flow.wiring[id]["over"]` (mirroring WaitNode's timed `until`), pre-resolved into `inputs["over"]`
by the engine's `eval_node` before `run`.

`run` returns one `Grow(Subgraph)` — self-describing expansion: it builds the whole MAP fan-in
subgraph (`map_subgraph` — N per-element child clones PLUS a synthesized `EndNode.list_` fan-in over
the child ENDs) and the engine's generic `_apply_grow` splices it into the live graph, with a
per-kind MAP residual (depth/refdepth/finish-mark + the transitional per-element
boundary-assert/ledger). The `Grow.seed` is the raw list of per-element records (the durable builder
input); an empty `over` -> a subgraph whose sole node is the list-`END` (it emits `[]`). The
per-element call-args go RAW: the spliced child START_ID owns omitted-input defaulting (its params
carry default/required), so the driver no longer pre-defaults. `child`/`child_inputs`/`child_asserts`
are baked at load by `compose.build` (`build_call_node`); `child_inputs` is read by compile
validation (`check_ref_map_types`) AND at runtime by the engine's per-element boundary-assert temp
pool (to mirror START_ID's coerce+default view). `parallel` is inert (concurrency is the engine's
`num_workers`); it is carried for the over case.

    The `List.map` driver (`kind: map` + `over:`) — map a callable flow over a list (`list['a] -> list['b]`).

    The MAP half of the REF/MAP pair (the REF half is
    [`CallNode`][agent_composer.nodes.call.node.CallNode]). The `over` source is pre-resolved into
    `inputs["over"]` by the engine bind seam; `run` returns one `Grow(Subgraph)` — it builds the
    whole MAP fan-in (N per-element child clones + a synthesized list END) via `map_subgraph`, and
    the engine's generic `_apply_grow` splices it and grows the live graph. The spliced child START
    owns omitted-input defaulting, so per-element call-args go raw.

    Args:
        node_id (`str`):
            The node's unique id.
        flow_id (`str`):
            The id of the child flow to map.
        parallel (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Inert — concurrency is the engine's `num_workers`; carried for the `over` case.
        flow_version (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            A pinned child flow version, if any.
        child (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The baked child flow (stamped at load); a `None` child raises at run time.
        child_inputs (`list`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The child's input decls, read by compile validation and the per-element temp pool.
        child_asserts (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The child's baked boundary asserts.
        child_source (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The child flow's render-only `SourceFrame` (label + node-line maps). Carried
            for the CLI's nested-error traceback only; `run` ignores it entirely.
        title (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Display title.
