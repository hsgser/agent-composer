"""The Node base contract — the single most portable idea from graphon.

A node is a **pure function of its bound input record**: it implements
`run(inputs, **caps) -> NodeResult` and returns ONE of the closed sum
`Output | Route | Pause | Grow` (the node-result sum type) — **or**, for a streaming
kind, a generator that yields `StreamChunk` and then *returns* a `NodeResult`.
The node never receives the pool: the engine's `runtime.eval_node` seam binds its
inputs (the read boundary) and hands it a record. The one effectful kind that still
needs a narrow capability is a mapped `call` (`bind_item`, a keyword-only arg); every other kind
takes only `inputs`. Failure is **not** a variant — a failing node `raise`s and the
engine boundary turns it into `NodeFailed`. A returned `Pause` becomes one
`PauseRequested`; the engine delivers the answer as the parked leaf's `Output`
(deliver-as-Output — the node never re-runs). A streaming kind is a generator that
yields `StreamChunk` and *returns* its `NodeResult` (drained by `_drain_node_generator`).

Invariant: a node never writes the pool. It *describes* its one output value as
`Output(value)`; the engine performs the write under `node_id`. Keeps nodes pure.

    `StreamChunk` and returns a `NodeResult`). The node never receives the pool — the engine's

    *describes* its one output as `Output(value)` and the engine performs the write under the
    node id. Failure is a `raise`, not a variant.

    Attributes:
        kind (`NodeKind`):
            The closed-vocabulary tag the engine dispatches on. Set per subclass.
        id (`str`):
            The node's unique id within its (possibly namespaced) flow.
        title (`str`, *optional*):
            A human-friendly display title, or `None`.
        output_shape (`Shape`, *optional*):
            The declared output Shape (one value); `None` leaves the write unenforced.
        params (`list[ParamDecl]`, *optional*):
            The node-side declared params (no source — the flow owns the wiring); `None`
            for a node that declares no inputs.
        pre_asserts (`list[str]`):
            Node-local `asserts:` checked against the bound record before `run`.
        post_asserts (`list[str]`):
            Node-local `asserts:` (reading `${output}`) checked after `run`.
        commit_as (`str`, *optional*):
            Engine-baked commit redirect: write this node's Output under `commit_as`
            instead of its own id (and fire that target's out-edges). Set by the
            `_grow_*` expanders on a subflow terminal (a CALL/MAP child END filler,
            a MAP END-list filler, an agent resume continuation) to point back at the
            spawner id; `None` for an ordinary node (commit under its own id).
        origin_id (`str`, *optional*):
            "Attribute my grows and self-commit to this origin node." `None` on every
            ordinary node. Set only on a self-respawning loop driver: the compiled loop
            `L` sets `origin_id = L` (== self) and each fresh per-iteration clone `L~k`
            sets `origin_id = L` too, so the engine can attribute every iteration's
