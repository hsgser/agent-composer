"""eval_node — the engine's node-evaluation seam.

A node is a pure function of its bound input record; the ENGINE owns both boundaries —
the read (bind the inputs from the pool) and the write (the dispatcher stores `Output`).
This generator is that read seam plus the assert + dispatch normalization, lifted out of
the node (it replaces the temporary `Node._emit`). It yields `NodeStarted`, binds the
record, pre-resolves reserved keys (timed WAIT `until` / mapped-call `over`), builds the per-kind
narrow caps (a mapped call's `bind_item`, and `caps['llm']` — the engine-owned model factory —
for an LLM-backed node gated on `node.needs_llm`), runs the node,
and turns the returned `NodeResult` into one terminal `NodeSucceeded`/`NodeFailed` — or a
single `PauseRequested` for a returned `Pause`.

Every node-side failure path funnels to `NodeFailed` so the two engines (serial + parallel)
agree byte-for-byte on the same input: a node `raise`, a `Grow` returned by a NON-spawner
kind, and a non-`NodeResult` return all become `NodeFailed` inside the `try` — none
escape the generator uncaught. (A spawner's `Grow` instead becomes `NodeExpanded`.)

The bind is PURE: it reads the node's sources ONLY from `flow.wiring[node.id]` joined to the
node's `params` — the node carries no source. Direct-drive tests supply a stub `flow` with
`wiring` (the test helpers derive it). Layer: runtime imports nodes.* freely.

Accepted bind ordering vs the old per-node `_run` (both on states a loaded flow cannot reach,
both still terminating in `NodeFailed`): a timed WAIT re-resolves `until` on every path including
release/resume (harmless given the monotonic pool), and a `call` that is BOTH unbaked AND has a
bad `over`/binding surfaces the over/bind error before the not-baked guard (loader always bakes).

    ONE generic assert-check for both pre- and post-asserts, kind-blind. Per assert, each
    reference resolves from the widest scope that owns it, mirroring the two historical
    resolution rules with no `node.kind` branch:
      - head already in `record` (a declared input, or the synthetic `output` the caller
        injects for post-asserts) -> `record`, via the dotted `_resolve_in_record` walk
        (the node-local rule);
      - any other head -> the pool, via full-path `resolve_reference` (the END pool-fallback
        for namespaced cross-node refs like `${each#0/n.output.X}` that ride END from expand).

    A raising assert (an ordered/arith comparison over a None/non-scalar ref) does NOT hold —
    the same clean-NodeFailed contract as `Node._assert_holds`; only `ExpressionError` is
    swallowed (the domain the condition engine raises in), so a real bug still surfaces.

    Args:
        asserts (`list[str]`): the assert expressions (any `when:`/`asserts:` spelling).
        record (`dict`): the bound scope — input params (+ synthetic `output` for post).
        pool (`TypedVariablePool`): the live pool for cross-node/namespaced ref fallback.
