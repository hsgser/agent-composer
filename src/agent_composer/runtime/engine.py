"""FlowEngine — one engine, one knob (`num_workers`).

A producer/consumer engine with two drive modes behind a single `num_workers`
knob, sharing one set of state-mutation helpers (`_on_success`/`_on_pause`/
`_advance`/`_branch`/`_skip_edge`):

- `num_workers=0` (default) — the single-threaded inline drain: the caller's
  thread pops the ready queue, runs each node's generator inline, applies the
  consequences, and forwards events. This is the deterministic path (exact event
  ordering, no `event_q` hop); golden-locked in F0.
- `num_workers>=1` — a fixed worker pool with a single-writer dispatcher: N
  daemon workers pull ids off `ready_q`, run `eval_node`, and push events onto
  `event_q`; the dispatcher (`run()`'s generator) drains `event_q`, forwards each
  event, and applies the *same* mutation helpers. The dispatcher is the sole
  writer of graph/edge/pool state.

Both modes capture all of graphon's *correctness* (3-state edge join, exact-once
fan-in, outputs-before-successors, branch skip-flood). `resume()` drives under the
same `num_workers` mode the engine carries (serial or pooled), via the shared
`_drive_to_terminal`.

Load-bearing orderings (do not reorder):
- A node's outputs are written to the pool **before** any successor is scheduled.
- A successor is scheduled only when `disposition` (via `is_node_ready`) says it is
  ready — an edge-class-aware join: a diamond fires exactly once, a control edge
  hard-gates (veto) and a required data group co-skips; a `dead` head is
  skip-flooded by `_skip_edge`.

    A producer/consumer engine with two drive modes behind one `num_workers` knob: the

    with a single-writer dispatcher. Both capture the same correctness (3-state edge
    join, exact-once fan-in, outputs-before-successors, branch skip-flood). Suspended
    runs can be captured with [`snapshot`][agent_composer.FlowEngine.snapshot] and

            The compiled graph to execute. The engine mutates it in place when a spawner

        pool (`TypedVariablePool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The variable pool to read/write. A fresh empty pool is created when `None`.
        num_workers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `0`):
            `0` runs the deterministic inline drain on the caller's thread; `>=1` spawns
            that many daemon workers behind a single-writer dispatcher. Clamped to `>=0`.
        run_inputs (`dict`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The flow's run arguments, seeded into the START node once at init. `None` for

        boundary_asserts (`list`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
