"""Agent Composer — a generic runner for a *workflow of nodes*.

Owns its execution runtime (a single-writer dispatcher over a fixed worker pool),
a typed serializable variable pool, and a durable suspend/resume protocol (the
basis for HUMAN_INPUT and WATCH nodes). See the project README for status.

Layers, leaf-to-root (a package imports only DOWN/leftward — never up, never in a cycle):

    events  <-  state  <-  nodes  <-  compile  <-  compose  <-  runtime  ->  suspension
                            ^  ^
                expr  ──────┘  └──────  llm_clients      (both leaves, imported by nodes upward)

Leaves import nothing else in the layer: `events`, `state` (the typed value pool), `expr`
(`${...}` evaluation), and `llm_clients` (provider client wrappers + `LLMConfig` — the AGENT
node's model seam). `nodes` are the node kinds — the synthesized boundary kinds own their
reserved ids (`StartNode.ID == "__start__"`, `EndNode.ID == "__end__"`). `compile` is the
compiled `CompiledFlow` IR + representation-neutral validation checkers (and re-exports the
boundary ids as `START_ID`/`END_ID`/`START_ID`/`END_ID`); `compose` reads Compose-shaped YAML into a
runnable `CompiledFlow`; `runtime` executes it; `suspension` is the checkpoint/resume protocol.
Nothing here imports a DB or a server; the durable (cross-process) suspend/resume
seam lives outside and is injected.
