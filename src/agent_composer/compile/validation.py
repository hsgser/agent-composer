These operate on bare `Type`/`Edge`/path-set inputs (never a `FlowSpec`), so the
Compose loader (`agent_composer.compose`) reuses them directly:

- `_reject_cycles` — Kahn's-algorithm cycle check over a bare edge list + node-id set.
- `_classify_path` — head-resolution for one dotted `${...}` ref + the dotted
  record-field walk, dispatched through `_walk_record_fields`.
- `_walk_record_fields` — the dotted-field-into-a-record check.

`FlowValidationError` is the shared structural-error type the compose loader catches
and re-raises as a located `LoadError`.
