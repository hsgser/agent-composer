"""The compiled flow graph: nodes, edges, adjacency, and the node-state vocabulary.

`CompiledFlow` is immutable topology — the nodes and how they connect. All mutable run
state (which nodes/edges were taken or skipped) lives in the runtime's state manager, so one
`CompiledFlow` can back many independent runs. `NodeState` is the per-node state vocabulary
the runtime tracks against that topology.

`START_ID` / `END_ID` are the reserved boundary-node ids. Every flow begins with a synthesized
START node (which binds the run inputs) and ends with a synthesized END node (whose value is the
flow's result). They are owned canonically by the node classes (`StartNode.ID` / `EndNode.ID`)
and re-exported here so runtime consumers can import them alongside the graph types.
