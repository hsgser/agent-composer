"""Resolve each AGENT node's effective `llm_config` by walking the static call tree.

Run ONCE at run start (the CLI layer is known only then). Fill-the-gap is per-field,
most-specific-wins, which is associative, so one top-down walk that accumulates the parent
config and bakes the effective dict onto every `AgentNode` is correct for arbitrary nesting.
Each node carrying a static child flow (CALL/MAP/LOOP) is DEEP-COPIED before recursion so a
shared/memoized def or external flow is never mutated and two callsites with different parent
configs stay isolated; runtime
expansion (`clone_child`) then deep-copies an already-resolved child, so the effective configs
ride into the live graph with no change to `expand.py`. On a DURABLE resume this must run
BEFORE `FlowEngine.restore` (restore's replay re-clones children from
`self.flow.nodes[spawner_id].child` — see `compose/run.py` / `runtime/engine.py`).

Layer: compile — imports nodes + compile.model only; never runtime.
