"""Runtime graph-expansion machinery — the pure half.

When a spawner (REF / MAP / agent-pause) runs, it does not run a child engine; it
returns a *description* (`Grow(Flow)`) and the engine GROWS the live graph by cloning the
target child(ren) deep-namespaced into the running `CompiledFlow`. This module holds the
**pure** machinery that growth keys off:

- `ns` / `map_callsite` / `ask_resume_edge_id`: deterministic id minting. Every
  cloned node/edge id is a pure function of `(callsite, child static id, element index)` —
  NO emission counter — so a re-clone on kill-recovery re-keys identically.

The pure cloner (`clone_child`) splices the child's own
`START_ID..END_ID` (every flow is `START_ID -> body -> END_ID`) into a `Flow`: the child `START_ID`
is the alias-seed point — SEEDED WITH THE CALL-ARGS AS EDGES (no `_rens` literal-baking) — and the
child `END_ID` is the alias filler. A child node reading `${input.X}` is re-pointed to the namespaced
child START_ID's output object (`${<callsite>/<start>.output.X}`); the dispatcher
consumes the descriptions and performs the (impure) `add_subgraph` + `register` + seed.

Layer: compile — imports `nodes`/`model`/`expr` (ladder-legal); never `runtime`.
