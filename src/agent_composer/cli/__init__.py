"""The `ac` command-line interface — a thin host over the run/resume seam.

`ac run FLOW.yaml` loads a Compose flow, gathers its inputs (flags first, then an
interactive prompt for any missing required one), drives it to a terminal, resumes
any HUMAN_INPUT / WAIT pause interactively, and renders the output. The CLI owns no
engine logic: it calls `agent_composer.compose.run` directly.
