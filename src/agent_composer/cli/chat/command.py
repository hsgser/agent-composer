"""`ac chat` — an interactive REPL dogfooded as a flow.

Loads the bundled composer chat flow (or a user-supplied one), runs it, and drives the
per-turn human_input suspend/resume: print the assistant's latest reply, prompt the
user, resume with the message. `/exit` or EOF ends the session. The turn loop and
tools live here; the engine sees only an ordinary flow.

A single bad turn does not end the session. The reply agent can fail mid-turn (a raise,
or hitting its tool-iteration cap), which terminates the underlying flow *run* as
`failed`. Because the transcript is mirrored host-side off the fold node's output, the
loop surfaces the error and RESTARTS the flow seeded with the accumulated transcript, so
the conversation continues from where it left off.
